# ImageColorDistro
Match identical and similar images

This is not a hash matching approach.

This code uses statistical correlation to match identical and similar images across and between the three most common internet formats: .jpg, .bmp and .png

The match is based upon pixel colors rather than the bits and bytes of the image file. It is immune to image orientation differences, metadata differences, and is robust against image resizing.
